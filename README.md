# Quantum Neural Network vs Classical Models for Advance-Fee Fraud Detection

This repository contains code and the term research paper for COMP 265 (Machine Learning for Cybersecurity).

## Contents

- `code/` – Python notebooks for:
  - Quantum Neural Network (QNN) using a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC)
  - Logistic Regression and SVM baselines
- `data/` – Synthetic Advance-Fee Fraud (AFF) dataset with Inter-Payment Interval (IPI) and numerical features
- `figures/` – Accuracy, classification speed, and confusion matrix plots
- `paper/` – Term paper: **Quantum Machine Learning for Timing-Based Advance-Fee Fraud Detection**

## Research Focus

- Compare QNN vs Logistic Regression vs SVM on:
  - Accuracy and confusion matrix
  - Classification speed (inference latency)
- Study how adding behavioral (IPI) and numerical features affects performance.
